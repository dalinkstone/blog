        </h2>
        <p>My mission statement that I wrote in highschool was:
        </p>
        <p><i>My ambitions in life include becoming the best husband and father that I can possibly be for my future family. Similarly, these ambitions are also a part of my life purpose. I want to be the very best person I can be for my future spouse and children. I also have a desire to serve and love God.</i></p>
        <p>My daughter was just born and I am now, on paper, both a husband and a father. Allbeit far from the best, it seems that the bar in today's world is relatively low. Be present, help out, provide something, don't complain, love generously and refrain from anger meets about 80% of the criteria for best.</p>
        <p>There has been an increasing amount of media around the decline of birth rates and the impending slowing of population growth throughout the world. Implicitly this would suggest slowing across several sectors of society. Economic and industrial growth might certainly be impacted if birth as a whole were to dip below the notorious 2.1 threshold. This seems incredibly likely given that most western countries are too hedonistically busy.</p>
        <p>The happiest moments of my day now are when I am holding my new born with my wife asleep by my side. I have never felt more peace and joy then being surrounded by the women I love.</p>
        <p>I've noticed that I have more drive and focus on being successful and knowledgeable with another mouth to feed and person to love. Children seem to be a great motivator for doing your best work and thinking of new ways to take calculated risks.</p>
        <h2>lesson</h2>
        <p>Love is the strongest power in the universe.
        </p>
        <p><b>Find a spouse to love forever and have children with them. Nothing will make you happier or give you more motivation to exercise grit.</b></p>
