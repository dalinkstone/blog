				<p><b>tldr;</b> be responsible
					for the suggestions,
					direction, counsel,
					critique, and feedback
					you give to someone who
					is clearly subordinate to you in
					seniority</p>
				<p>Interviewing has always been
					incredibly nerve racking
					and anxiety inducing for me.
					I've found that despite
					my best efforts to prepare to be
					"on the spot" I usually come up
					short in actual execution. This
					definitely speaks to my
					inability to interview
					well more than it speaks
					to an interviewers inability to
					deal with this shortcoming (not
					that they should
					anyways). One of the
					first 'big break'
					interviews I had was at
					<a href="https://www.franklincovey.com/">Franklin Covey</a> for a Data
					Analyst Intern
					role.
				</p>
				<p>The FTE on the team led the
					technical interview and
					it was honestly pretty simple.
					There were two queries
					that we were supposed to
					write in a Google Doc. The first
					was something to do with 'pull X
					columns, with Y filter,
					and only return B rows'.
					I asked some questions and then
					typed out an appropriate
					response. It was
					acceptable. The question
					completely stumped me. It was
					"using these three
					tables, get X data with
					Y filter, and only
					return B rows." If
					you've ever written SQL
					this is probably quite easy; you
					can already visualize what the
					query would kind of look
					like. So what stumped me? I
					didn't even know you
					could do multiple JOINs.
					I had been self teaching data
					analytics and doing a
					lot of reading. This was
					before AI was widely available,
					so I spent most of my time
					reading and watching
					every 101 and 102 SQL
					intro you could find.
					The interviewer got
					noticeably frustrated
					with me, he stopped the
					interview, said something about
					"measuring your heuristics" and
					then wrote the query talking
					about how 'n function'
					could be used to
					aggregate the data.</p>
				<p>I was soul crushed to say the
					least. I told him I didn't
					realize you could
					actually do multiple
					JOINs. I was embarassed.
					Then I went back to my day-job
					handling an email
					security queue. Labeling
					hundreds of emails a day by
					clicking some keys on my
					keyboard. I was in a dark place
					at the time because I felt like
					I had completely misued the
					college opportunity to
					learn and grow. I had
					convinced myself that
					passion was something
					for everyone else except
					for me. I felt more lost than
					before and like I needed
					to apply to another university
					bachelors degree to
					learn this heuristic
					thing Zane talked about
					during the interview. I also
					felt like I was
					constantly behind in
					terms of knowledge.
					There was a piece of
					comparison poison where
					I was unkindly weighing my past
					and current state against
					someone with a massively
					different background and current
					state. However, there were
					others who were more or
					less in the same position I was
					in who knew so much more. How
					did I get here?</p>
				<p>I think that pretty
					accurately depicts the
					feeling of being lost
					that I had at the time.
					What I wish Zane would have said
					was, "This is awkward for both
					of us. Look, I can't
					hire you but let me talk
					through the solution and
					you ask me questions if
					it doesn't make sense."
					Then maybe he'd give me a pep
					talk about learning
					more, trying harder, or
					reaching out for career guidance
					in a few months. Instead, I
					ended up doing some more
					self studying, stumbling through
					my job, getting a promotion out
					of sheer willpower, and then
					getting cat fished into
					joining <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/">Goldman</a>,
					spending another two
					years stumbling through
					data videos and
					articles, eventually
					landing back in
					university. Through all
					of that experience there were
					even more interviews I
					failed, like the
					interview for <a href="https://www.hudsonrivertrading.com/careers/">Hudson River
						Trading</a> where I
					literally typed 'sorry
					for wasting your time'
					in the editor before
					clicking submit when I
					had stared at this
					'count how many of each
					letters appear in this
					array' question. Or when
					I completely guessed on the
					<a href="https://www.google.com/about/careers/applications/">Google</a> Youtube
					Analyst
					SQL question and
					confidently put down the
					wrong answer for another
					question. Or that time I
					opened the <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/careers.html">Cisco</a>
					coding exam
					read the first problem
					that was about some kind
					of dual-list comparison, closed
					my laptop, and went for a walk.
					Or that other time I interviewed
					for the <a
						href="https://www.teamworkonline.com/baseball-jobs/tampa-bay-rays/tampa-bay-rays">Tampa
						Bay Rays</a> and got
					cut because my
					'Baseball' card take home
					was so poorly done they couldn't
					understand what I had written or
					why it looked that way.
				</p>
				<p>At each of these moments,
					there was (mostly) an
					opportunity for someone
					who knew more than me,
					was better equipped for
					raw decision navigation,
					and could make a well
					informed decision about
					what I should have been
					doing with my life.
					Instead, I was likely
					laughed at after the
					interview or in the case
					of most of those coding
					exams, confusedly stared
					at. So what?</p>
				<p>From one side, this is in
					fact pure cope. Of
					course it is. From the
					other side, why wouldn't
					you take less than 1
					minute to be a guiding
					hand in someones
					life?</p>
				<p>I am disappointed in my
					inability to take full
					advantage of life
					changing opportunities
					while simultaneously
					never exercising maximum
					effort in making those dreams
					become reality. That
					statement can be true
					and not be completely
					orthogonal to the idea
					of having someone say,
					"Just go back to
					university", or "Did you
					even read X Y Z books?"
					Anything to provide a
					little course
					correction. I definitely
					realize how inept I was
					at the time and I've
					since spent months and
					years trying to undo
					that. A little help
					doesn't seem like too
					much to ask for.</p>
				<p>Why is this not more common
					place and applied
					universally in
					everything we do? What
					is there to lose from
					the perspective of
					someone in a place of
					seniority or even 'more
					knowledge'?</p>
				<p>I recently interviewed at
					<a href="https://railway.com">Railway</a> and had the best
					experience ever. The team there
					had put together a <a href="https://station.railway.com/bounties">platform</a>
					that
					allows candidates (and anyone
					who creates a Railway
					account) to handle
					support tickets. It is
					an experience to perform
					the day-to-day job, receive some
					kind of compensation (in the
					form of cash, since it's
					a bounty program), and
					better understand the
					trends and kinds of
					issues that users face.
					Candidates are asked to complete
					up to 5 bounties after the
					recruiter screen and
					prior to meeting the
					team. It takes the place
					of a technical interview with a
					mild Support focus. I ended up
					stumbling through the
					actual interview portion
					when asked questions like "How
					would you fix this?",
					"What would you
					change?". However, I was
					given some of that direction I
					had been craving the
					past 4 years.
				</p>
				<p>"It seems you are
					underutilised where you
					are now." Finally.
					Someone who knows more
					than me about the
					general domain of where
					I work and where I want to go,
					who can provide a highly
					opinionated and informed
					perspective. This really
					got me thinking about what am I
					doing in my current role and
					what I wish I could be
					doing and how that gap
					can be closed.</p>
				<p>What I've been doing since
					then is trying to
					diagnose where it is I
					want to go and how I
					want to get there.
					Currently, I think there
					is a lot of utility and power in
					focusing on a single tech stack.
					Personally, I want one that is
					cost efficient and
					universal enough to open
					plenty of future doors. I think
					the tech stack has to be simple
					enough to be effective, yet
					different enough to make
					it easier to learn other stacks.
					This will probably lead me to
					completely refactor the
					project I have been working on
					and continue to improve
					it so that it can be launched
					and used. Next, I need
					to read a lot more. I've
					found that I am not well spoken
					in terms of verbalizing my
					thoughts. I think this
					comes from a lack of
					written literature being
					often consumed by my brain.
					Recently I've been
					reading <a
						href="https://www.amazon.com/Theory-Games-Economic-Behavior-Commemorative/dp/0691130612">Theory
						of Games and
						Economic
						Behavior</a>, <a
						href="https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321">Designing
						Data-Intensive Applications</a>,
					<a
						href="https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Systems-Programmers-Perspective-3rd/dp/013409266X">Computer
						Systems: A
						Programmers
						Perspective</a>,
					<a
						href="https://www.amazon.com/Software-Engineering-Google-Lessons-Programming/dp/1492082791">Software
						Engineering at
						Google</a>,
					and <a
						href="https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1849967202">Skiena's
						Algorithm
						Design</a>
					book. This seems like a
					good spot to add better
					vocabulary, different
					perspective, and focused
					thinking to my current state.
					Couple that with
					building something I am
					actually excited about and it
					seems like that is a
					good way I can begin to
					really utilize myself before
					asking others to do so.
				</p>
				<h2>lesson</h2>
				<p>it's okay to not know what to do and
					to attempt to reason through
					decisions. don't do it
					alone. seek help from
					those who have done it
					before. find mentors
					everywhere.</p>
				<p><b>being even a single step ahead of
						another makes you a
						potential influence in
						someone's fate. expand
						other's curiosity and offer
						opinionated and informed
						perspective when
						possible.</b></p>
