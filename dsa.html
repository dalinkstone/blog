				<p>data structures are actually a quite
					simple idea. there is nothing
					special about the
					structure of an array
					other than the fact that
					the actual application of an
					array in a programming
					language varies slightly and introduces this
					idea of variables and
					data as 'objects'.</p>
				<p>this is the second paragraph</p>
				<h2>lesson</h2>
				<p>mathematics is easily the most
					important topic and
					concept to learn and
					understand well as a
					fundamental component of
					the human existence.</p>
				<p><b>spend lots of time learning
						mathematics, arithmetic,
						algebra, calculus,
						discrete mathematics and
						then seek opportunities
						to apply it in the world.</b></p>
