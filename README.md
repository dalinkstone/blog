resume.html is the page that has the resume on the blog 

book-review-how-to-solve-it.html is an incomplete and unstarted blog post that was meant to be a book review of george polyas how to solve it 

## upcoming 
i want to write more often. this will be a continual upcoming goal where
i want to write at least once a week or once a month. i'm not sure when
this will start, because i need to spend time reading and doing things
before writing anything.


## completed
we need to optimize the SEO such that this blog post is the first result for the search query "dalin stone". it is the first returned result for the search query "dalinstone" likely because that is the url.

one potential thought here is to learn about the keywords and how those work and then use the Google Search Console to attempt to optimize the page so that it is returned as the first result when someone googles me. 

this is the single most important priority for the blog, is ensuring that it is the first result when someone searches for me. it should not be the second or third result. it should be at the immediate top.
